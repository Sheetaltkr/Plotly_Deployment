# Plotly_Deployment
## Purpose
- Discover and document the bacteria unknown to science or those that have not been studied enough
- Research bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef
- Build a dashboard that helps researchers and research participants check ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in the respective navels.

## Background
The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different bodyparts harbor different species.
The hypothesis is that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef, may be found in human belly button. As part of hypothesis testing the navels of people across the country have been sampled in order to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons.Theyâ€™ve instead assigned an id number. There is a need to have a dashboard which helps researchers and participants see the bacterial species that live in the navels.
